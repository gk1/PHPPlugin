    "description": "A simple > PHP5.3 plugin system supporting plugin descriptor files and extension points. It is inspired by the eclipse and jira plugin architectures. In combination with a dependency manager (Composer), a module system (for example Symfony bundles) and a depency injection framework (for example the Symfony service container) this provides a very powerfull way of building a pluggable architecture in a PHP application. It can be easily extended to filter loaded plugins based on your own criteria which allows for different levels op application functionalities (maybe based on subscription level).",
